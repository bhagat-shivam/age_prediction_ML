Steps in Building an Age Prediction Model

1) Data Collection: Collect relevant features such as images, demographics, or text. Data quality is crucial for the performance of the model.
2) Feature Engineering: Transform raw data into meaningful features. For images, this may involve face detection and alignment. For text, natural language processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization and word embeddings are applied.
3) Model Selection: Choose between regression or classification models depending on whether the target variable is continuous (exact age) or categorical (age group).
4) Training and Testing: Split the data into training and test sets, and evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression or accuracy for classification.
5) Evaluation: Itâ€™s important to ensure that the model generalizes well across different age groups and is not biased toward a particular group.
